### Section C
I choose Option 1: Say the Number and I wrote the code in Ruby on Rails using
Ruby. 
I have deployed the app in Heroku and also made a user interface where anyone can 
use the app.
You can access it on this link: https://number-to-word.herokuapp.com
The source code repository can be accessed on this link: https://github.com/elianbraja/sayNumber

The service file that contains the main logic can be checked here: https://github.com/elianbraja/sayNumber/blob/main/lib/services/number_to_sentence.rb.

### Setup Instructions
The app can be set up using Docker.
Make sure to have docker and docker-compose installed in your machine

To install Docker please follow this link:
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

To install Docker Compose please follow this link:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

After installing docker and docker compose, run `docker-compose up`.
Wait pulling images from DockerHub and container creation.
After that app will be serving at `localhost:3000`.

Thank you!
